<h1>Write-up</h1>
<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Merge sort will outperform insertion sort for all but very small lists, with the difference in speed becoming particularly apparent for very large lists. As for just how small the list will have to get for insertion sort to outpace merge sort, I'd guess low double digits.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>
    The code I used to test these algorithms can be found at <a href="https://github.com/khuldraeseth/cse431hw4">https://github.com/khuldraeseth/cse431hw4</a>. Clone the repository, move into <kbd>p1</kbd>, and <kbd>stack run -- --output wherever-you-want-the-results.html</kbd> to run these tests yourself. Compiles with <kbd>-threaded</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
    These are my own implementations of insertion sort and merge sort, written in Haskell. Merge sort does not split the list at the middle—rather, it uses the inverse of an interleave (which I have named <kbd>unterleave</kbd>) that takes <kbd>[a,b,c,d,e] ↦ ([b,d], [a,c,e])</kbd> as an example for what I expect may be a moderate speedup. Since merge sort is not stable anyway, nothing is lost here.

<h3>Results</h3>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>
    Not quite as I had expected. For starters, merge sort is faster in these tests than insertion sort for very small lists as well as sufficiently large ones! This makes sense in retrospect—I have special cases in my merge sort code for empty and singleton cases, so these are just one pattern match from being sorted, rather than a call to <kbd>foldr</kbd>. Then insertion sort has its time on top, outperforming merge sort for lists of length 3, 4, and 5. The two cross somewhere between 5 and 10, and repeated tests show no consistent particular value.
</p>
<p>
    Interesting is that insertion sort, after being outpaced by an order of magnitude on lists of length 35, makes a resurgence and competes with merge sort again for lengths 50, 75, and 100 before falling off again at 200 and never having a third chance. I'll attribute this to some compile-time optimization.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Under the conditions tested, merge sort was faster than insertion sort on lists of all lengths except those between 3 and 10.
